Congratulations, the Sitecore.Mvc.Contrib.Sample package is now installed in your website project.

Next Steps
==========

1. Run a build on your Visual Studio solution

2. Publish the master database using Sitecore Rocks.

   http://<domain>/sample



Fixing Installation Issues
==========================

If the sample package failed to install check the following:

*  Is your website projected configured to use a Sitecore.Rocks connection?

   Select the Sitecore -> Connect... option on the website project in the Solution Explorer.

*  Is the Sitecore.Rocks connection located outside of the <Local IIS Sites> folder in the Sitecore Explorer?

   Drag the website connection in the Sitecore.Explorer and move it so that it resides as a child of the Connections folder.

*  Does your solution build fail to restore NuGet packages?

   Ensure that the Package Restore checkbox has been ticked in the NuGet Package Manager Options dialog.

    Uninstall-Package Sitecore.Mvc.Contrib.Sample
	Uninstall-Package Sitecore.Mvc.Contrib



Uninstalling the Package

The package can be uninstalled by running the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

    Uninstall-Package Sitecore.Mvc.Contrib.Sample
	Uninstall-Package Sitecore.Mvc.Contrib


Note: It is possible to just uninstall the sample package on it's own and leave the core contrib project and it's functionality in place.
