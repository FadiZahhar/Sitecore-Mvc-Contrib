<h2>Injected View in Placeholder</h2>
<p>This content has been injected into a Sitecore placeholder.</p>

<ul>
    <li>An action method on the HelloWorld controller was invoked by the route matching the HTTP request</li>
    <li>A ViewResult was returned by the action method</li>
    <li>A View was located by a ViewEngine and it's contents were loaded into a ContentRendering</li>
    <li>The Placeholder property of the ContentRendering was set from the scPlaceholder route data value</li>
    <li>The new ContentRendering was added to the renderings associated with the PageContext</li>
    <li>The MVC runtime rendered the content using the PageContext.PageView</li>
</ul>

<p>To demonstrate the InjectViewInPlaceholderFilter functionality a single route has been installed by the sample package.</p>

<pre>
    RouteTable.Routes.MapRoute(
        "HelloWorld", // Route name
        "hello/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters
        new
        {
            controller = "HelloWorld",
            scItemPath = "/sitecore/content/Mvc Sample",
            scPlaceholder = "main",
            partialView = "true",
            id = UrlParameter.Optional
        });
</pre>

<p>The route can be tested by browsing to either:</p>

<ul class="navLinks">
    <li><a href="/hello">http://&lt;domain&gt;/hello</a></li>
    <li><a href="/hello/redir">http://&lt;domain&gt;/hello/redir</a></li>
</ul>
